externalObjects: {"I decided to make Unity3D Asset the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Unity3D-Asset) as Unity3D Asset is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Unity3D Asset language. It only makes sense to Unity3D Asset the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
